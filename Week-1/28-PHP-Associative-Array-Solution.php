    <title>Using Associative Arrays in PHP Solution</title>

<?php
    /**
     * Create an array of names and associate a color name to each
     * NOTE: The array should contain the names of more than three people and associated color
     */
    $colors = array('John'=>'Red', 'Jim'=>'Green', 'Jake'=>'Navy Blue', 'Jill'=>'Blue');

    /**
     * 1. Create an echo statement contains the string '<h4>My friend\'s favorite colors are: </h4><ul>'
     *    NOTE: Remember when using single quotes, the apostrophe in friend's needs to be escaped with a forward slash (\)
     * 2. Create a foreach loop that will loop through all of the ($colors as $c => $c_value) This will separate the associative array into their key and value pair
     * 3. In the loop code block, create an echo statement that creates a list of each person and their favorite color between line item tags
     *    EXAMPLE: '<li>' . $c . '\'s favorite color is ' . $c_value . '</li>'
     * 4. After the loop, create an echo statement that sends the closing unordered list tag to the browser
